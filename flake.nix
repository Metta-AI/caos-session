    # commit, and `integrations/claude-code/cloud/caos-pin.sh` reads it back out.

    # Move it with `nix flake update caos`, then update the two `rev=` values in
    # `.caos-expr` to match: `std/flake-input-loader` refuses to evaluate a tree
    # whose expression and lockfile disagree, naming both revisions, so this
    # cannot drift silently.
